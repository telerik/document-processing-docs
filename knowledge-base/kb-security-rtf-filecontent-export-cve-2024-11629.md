### What Are the Impacts

In Progress Telerik Document Processing Libraries, versions prior to 2025 Q1 (2025.1.2xx), using .NET Standard 2.0, the contents of a file at an arbitrary path can be exported to RTF.

## Solution

We have addressed the issue and the Progress Telerik team strongly recommends performing an upgrade to the latest version listed in the table below.

All customers who have a Telerik license can access the downloads here [Product Downloads | Your Account](https://www.telerik.com/account/downloads/product-download). Note, Telerik Document Processing is not a separate product, it is distributed with the primary product you are using. Therefore, we recommend upgrading the primary product to 2025 Q1 to automatically recieve the Document Processing improvements.
