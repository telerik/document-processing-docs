| ---- | ---- |
| < 2026.1.210 | [Telerik Document Processing]({%slug introduction%}) |

## Description

Microsoft has disclosed an [Arbitrary File Write vulnerability](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2ww3-72rp-wpp4) in the Semantic Kernel .NET SDK (GHSA-2ww3-72rp-wpp4). This issue impacts applications that directly use the **SessionsPythonPlugin** within the Semantic Kernel SDK.

> **Important:**  
> The vulnerable Semantic Kernel API members (`DownloadFileAsync` and `UploadFileAsync`) exist in the dependency chain, but **Telerik Document Processing Libraries do not use them in any way**.
>
>✅ Telerik Document Processing Libraries are *not affected* by this Semantic Kernel vulnerability.
There is **no exploit path**, and **no security risk** is introduced into applications using Telerik Document Processing.

The following [Telerik Document Processing]({%slug introduction%}) AI package includes the `Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Core` dependency through a transitive chain:

* **Telerik.Windows.Documents.AIConnector** (for .NET Framework and .NET 8, .NET 9, and .NET 10 on Windows)&mdash;This package references `Telerik.Documents.AI.RAG`, which in turn references `Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Core`.

## Solution

Even though Telerik Document Processing Libraries are **not impacted**, we recommend following general best practices by updating to the latest **Microsoft.SemanticKernel** version to ensure your overall application environment benefits from the upstream fix.
