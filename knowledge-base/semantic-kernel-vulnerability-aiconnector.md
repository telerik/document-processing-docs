# Microsoft.SemanticKernel Vulnerability in AIConnector Dependencies

## Environment

| Version | Product |
| ---- | ---- |
| 2026.1.210 | [Telerik Document Processing]({%slug introduction%}) |

## Problem

Microsoft has identified an [Arbitrary File Write vulnerability](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2ww3-72rp-wpp4) in the Semantic Kernel .NET SDK (GHSA-2ww3-72rp-wpp4). This vulnerability affects applications using Telerik Document Processing AI packages that depend on Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Core.

## Description

An [Arbitrary File Write vulnerability](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2ww3-72rp-wpp4) has been identified in Microsoft's Semantic Kernel .NET SDK, specifically within the SessionsPythonPlugin. Developers who have built applications which include Microsoft's Semantic Kernel .NET SDK and are using the SessionsPythonPlugin are impacted.

Telerik Document Processing AI packages have a dependency chain that includes the affected Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Core package:

- **Telerik.Windows.Documents.AIConnector** (for .NET Framework and .NET 8, .NET 9, and .NET 10 on Windows)
- **Telerik.Documents.AIConnector** (for .NET Standard 2.0, supporting .NET 8, .NET 9, and .NET 10)

Both packages depend on **Telerik.Documents.AI.RAG**, which in turn depends on **Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Core**.

The vulnerability has been fixed by Microsoft in **Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Core** version **1.70.0**.

## Solution

Upgrade to Telerik Document Processing version [2026.1.210](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/telerik-document-processing/release-history/progress-telerik-document-processing-2026-1-210) or later. This release includes the updated dependency to Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Core version 1.70.0, which addresses the security vulnerability.
