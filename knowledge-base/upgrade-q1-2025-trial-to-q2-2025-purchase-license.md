## Description

This article aims to explain how an **active** *trial* user (who started their trial less than 30 days before the Q2 2025 release) using a **Q1 2025** version can update to a **Q2 2025** *commercial* version using NuGet.

## Solution

For a successful upgrade, these users must consider the change in the NuGet package name â€” the Q2 2025 package has no ***Trial*** identifier in the name. These clients must uninstall the Q1 2025 version and install the Q2 2025 version for a successful upgrade. 

>caution Starting with [Telerik Document Processing version Q1 2025](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/license-key-files-telerik-kendo-ui-products-2025-update), you must activate the product through a [license key]({%slug setting-up-license-key%}) (trial or commercial).
