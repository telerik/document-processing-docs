## Setting the culture

__RadSpreadProcessing__ allows you to set a culture that differs from the current thread culture. This can be achieved by creating a new __CultureHelper__.

#### __C# Setting the Culture__

{{region cs-radspreadprocessing-features-setting-the-culture_1}}

    Telerik.Windows.Documents.Spreadsheet.Formatting.FormatHelper.CultureHelper = new SpreadsheetCultureHelper(new CultureInfo("en-US"));

{{endregion}}
