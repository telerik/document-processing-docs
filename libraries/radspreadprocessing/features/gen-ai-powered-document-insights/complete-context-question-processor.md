# CompleteContextQuestionProcessor

The **CompleteContextQuestionProcessor** class enables you to ask questions about an Excel document and receive answers based on the entire document content. This processor sends the complete document text to the AI model, which is suitable for smaller documents or when you need to ensure that the AI model has access to all the information in the document. This class inherits from the abstract **AIProcessorBase** class, which provides common functionality for all AI processors.

The **CompleteContextQuestionProcessor** is ideal for the following scenarios:

1. **Small Documents**: When the document is small enough to fit within the token limit of the AI model.
2. **Holistic Understanding**: When the question requires understanding the entire document context.
3. **Simplicity**: When you don't need the advanced embedding functionality of [PartialContextQuestionProcessor]({%slug radspreadprocessing-features-gen-ai-powered-document-insights-partial-context-question-processor%}).

However, if you're working with larger documents or want to optimize token usage, you should use the [PartialContextQuestionProcessor]({%slug radspreadprocessing-features-gen-ai-powered-document-insights-partial-context-question-processor%}#when-to-use-partialcontextquestionprocessor) instead.

## Public API

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|**Settings**|Gets the settings for the AI question-answering process. Returns [CompleteContextProcessorSettings]({%slug radspreadprocessing-features-gen-ai-powered-document-insights-complete-context-question-processor%}#completecontextprocessorsettings).|

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|**public Task<string> AnswerQuestion(SimpleTextDocument document, string question)**|Answers a question using the provided document. Parameters: **document** - The document containing the text to process, **question** - The question to answer. Returns a task that represents the asynchronous operation. The task result contains the answer to the question.|

>caution **Security Warning:** The output produced by this API is generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). As such, the content should be considered untrusted and may include unexpected or unsafe data. It is strongly recommended to properly sanitize or encode all output before displaying it in a user interface, logging, or using it in any security-sensitive context.

## CompleteContextProcessorSettings

The **CompleteContextProcessorSettings** class defines configuration options for the question-answering process. The following read-only properties can be set only through the constructor:

* **ModelMaxInputTokenLimit**: The maximum input token limit the model allows.
* **ModelId**: The ID of the model.
* **TokenizationEncoding**: The tokenization encoding.
* **ProduceJsonFormattedContext**: Determines whether the context sent to the model is in JSON or plain text format, if json format is applicable (dafault is *false*).

## Usage Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the **CompleteContextQuestionProcessor** to ask questions about an Excel document, including working with specific document pages. For setting up the AI client as shown in this example, see the [AI Provider Setup]({%slug radspreadprocessing-features-gen-ai-powered-document-insights-prerequisites%}#ai-provider-setup) section:
