# TOA (Table of Authorities) Field

>The TOA (Table of Authorities) field creates and inserts a table of authorities. The TOA field collects entries marked by TA (Table of Authorities Entry) fields.

In order to obtain the pages of TA fields, BookmarkRangeStart, and BookmarkRangeEnd fields you need to set the [FlowExtensibilityManager.NumberingFieldsProvider]({%slug radpdfprocessing-formats-and-conversion-pdf-numbering-fields-provider%}).

# Switches 

Switches are a way for the code fragment to specify formatting for the result of the field. More information is available in the [Syntax and Switches](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radwordsprocessing/concepts/fields/fields#syntax-and-switches) section of the _Fields_ article.

|\\h|Includes the category heading for the entries in a table of authorities.|
|\\l|Specifies the characters (up to fifteen) that separate multiple page references. |
|\\p|Replaces five or more different page references to the same authority with "passim".|
