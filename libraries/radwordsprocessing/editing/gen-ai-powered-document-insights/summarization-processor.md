# SummarizationProcessor

The **SummarizationProcessor** class enables you to generate concise summaries of Word documents using Large Language Models (LLMs). It inherits from the abstract **AIProcessorBase** class, which provides common functionality for all AI processors. It automatically handles large documents by splitting them into smaller chunks when needed, making it suitable for documents of any size.

## Public API

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|**Settings**|Gets the settings that will be used for summarization.|

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|**Task<string> Summarize(ISimpleTextDocument document)**|Generates a summary of the provided document. The parameter **document** is an **ISimpleTextDocument** containing the text to be summarized.|

|Event|Description|
|---|---|
|**EventHandler<SummaryResourcesCalculatedEventArgs> SummaryResourcesCalculated**|Triggered before the actual summarization process begins, providing information about the estimated resource usage. The **SummaryResourcesCalculatedEventArgs** provides properties: **EstimatedCallsRequired** (number of API calls required), **EstimatedTokensRequired** (number of tokens to be processed), and **ShouldContinueExecution** (boolean flag indicating whether to proceed with summarization, default is **true** for single-call and **false** for multi-call operations).|

>caution **Security Warning:** The output produced by this API is generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). As such, the content should be considered untrusted and may include unexpected or unsafe data. It is strongly recommended to properly sanitize or encode all output before displaying it in a user interface, logging, or using it in any security-sensitive context.

## SummarizationProcessorSettings

The **SummarizationProcessorSettings** class defines configuration options for the summarization process. The following read-only properties can be set only through the constructor:

* **ModelMaxInputTokenLimit**: The maximum input token limit for the model.
* **PromptAddition**: An addition for the prompt used for summarization. It can be used for clarification purposes.

## Usage Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the **SummarizationProcessor** to generate a summary of a Word document. To set up the AI client as shown in this example, see the [AI Provider Setup]({%slug radwordsprocessing-features-gen-ai-powered-document-insights-prerequisites%}#ai-provider-setup) section.

### Handling Large Documents

For large documents that exceed the token limit of the model, **SummarizationProcessor** automatically splits the document into smaller chunks and processes them separately:

1. The document is split into chunks that fit within the model's token limit.
2. Each chunk is summarized individually.
3. The individual summaries are combined and sent for a final summarization.

This approach allows the processor to efficiently handle documents of any size, but it increases the number of API calls required. The **SummaryResourcesCalculated** event provides information about the expected resource usage, allowing you to decide whether to proceed with the operation.
