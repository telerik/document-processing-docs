# Bookmarks (Outlines) 

Bookmarks or Outlines are a tree-structured hierarchy that the reader presents as a visual table of contents separated from the actual content as a side panel. The Bookmark items allow users, by interacting with them, to navigate through parts of the document and/or invoke different actions. PdfProcessing enables you to create bookmarks, modify existing ones and save the changes into the PDF document.

## BookmarkItem Class

This is the class representing a single bookmark inside the model of PdfProcessing. Each bookmark can have the following characteristics described in the respective properties:

* **IsExpanded**: Determines whether the bookmark item is open or closed by default. An item is open when its children are visible upon opening the document in a viewer.

* **Action**: Gets the action to be performed when this bookmark item is activated. For more information on how to work with actions, check the [Action]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-annotations-links%}#action) help topic.

* **Destination**: Gets the destination to be displayed when this bookmark item is activated. For more information on how to work with destinations, check the [Destination]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-annotations-links%}#destination) help topic.

* **NamedDestination**: Gets the named destination to be displayed when this bookmark item is activated. Check the [Named Destinations]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-named-destinations%}) topic for more details about these objects.

* **TextStyle**: Gets or sets the style characteristics for displaying the bookmark item's text. This property is of type **BookmarkItemStyles**. This type is a set of flags and can have the following values: **Normal**, **Italic** and/or **Bold**.

* **TextColor**: Gets or sets the color of the bookmark item's text in RGB color space.

* **Title**: Gets or sets the text to be displayed in the viewer's navigation pane for this bookmark item.

* **Children**: Gets the immediate child elements for this bookmark item.


### Working with BookmarkItem

The **BookmarkItem** class exposes several constructor overloads which enable you to set the title of the bookmark as well as what should be executed when the users click on it.

*  BookmarkItem(string title, Action action)
*  BookmarkItem(string title, Destination destination) 
*  BookmarkItem(string title, NamedDestination namedDestination)

## Bookmarks Collection

The **Bookmarks** property exposed through the **RadFixedDocument** class allows you to access all the bookmarks in a document so you can add, remove or reorder them. This property is a collection of [**BookmarkItem**](#bookmarkitem-class) objects which represent each bookmark.

Inserting a bookmark in a document is achieved by adding it to the Bookmarks collection. **Example 2** shows adding the **BookmarkItem** created in [**Example 1**](#example-1)

Removing a bookmark is pretty similar to adding one. In **Example 3**, the second bookmark inside the document is removed.

In case you need to iterate all the bookmarks in a document, keep in mind that each BookmarkItem can contain other bookmarks in its Children collection. If you are encountering such a case, you will need to iterate the Bookmarks collection recursively.
