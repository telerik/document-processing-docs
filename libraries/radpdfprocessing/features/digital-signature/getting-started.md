# Getting Started 

RadPdfProcessing allows adding a digital signature while editing a created from scratch document (or importing an existing one).

>To use the signing functionality in PdfProcessing for **.NET Standard/.NET Core**, you must add a reference to the **System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs** NuGet package, version 6 or newer (This functionality is available since R1 2022 SP1).

>note [PdfProcessing Digitally Sign Document Demo](https://demos.telerik.com/document-processing/pdfprocessing/digitally_sign_document)

## Signing a Document

To sign a document, follow the steps:

1\. Create a **Signature** object which takes a [X509Certificate2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509certificate2(v=vs.110).aspx) object as a parameter. This is the certificate that will be used to sign the PDF document.

2\. When instantiated, add the **Signature** to the document's content using a [SignatureField]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-interactive-forms-form-fields-signaturefield%}).

3\. To create a signature, which has a visual representation, you must create a [SignatureWidget]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-annotations-widgets%}) and associate the Widget annotation with the signed [SignatureField]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-interactive-forms-form-fields-signaturefield%}). The widget also needs a [FormSource]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-formsource-overview%}) object applied to its Content.**NormalContentSource** property. A **FormSource** could be filled with data using the FixedContentEditor.

>caution When exporting a digitally signed document, a stream that allows both, reading and writing, should be passed. Otherwise, an exception is thrown: *NotSupportedException: 'Stream does not support reading.'*.

The following example shows a full code snippet for a simple signing of a newly created document:

#### **[C#] Example: Sign a document**

>important In .NET Standard use __Telerik.Documents.Primitives.Rect__ instead of __System.Windows.Rect__.

>important When signing an existing document (after the import) we must be sure the AcroForm's ViewersShouldRecalculateWidgetAppearances property is set to false, otherwise, the exported and signed PDF document could not be shown as a signed. 

## Signature Encodings

RadPdfProcessing enables you to sign and validate signature fields using standard signature encodings:

* adbe.x509.rsa_sha1 (PKCS #1)

* adbe.pkcs7.sha1 (PKCS #7)

* adbe.pkcs7.detached (PKCS #7 Detached)

## Signature Flags

The signature flags were introduced in R2022 SP1. You can set the flags with the following code:

#### **[C#] Example: Set signature flags**

<snippet id='pdf-signature-flags'/>

The possible values are: 
* __None__: Indicates no signature fields exist.
* __SignaturesExist:__ If set, the document contains at least one signature field. This flag allows a viewer application to enable user interface items (such as menu items or pushbuttons) related to signature processing without having to scan the entire document for the presence of signature fields. 
* __AppendOnly:__ The document contains signatures that may be invalidated if the file is saved in a way that alters its previous contents. Viewer applications can use this flag to present a user requesting a full save with an additional alert box warning that signatures will be invalidated and requiring explicit confirmation before continuing with the operation.
