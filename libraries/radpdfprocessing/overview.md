# Overview

|RadPdfProcessing|Introduction|
|----|----|
![PdfProcessing](images/pdf-processing-overview.png)| **RadPdfProcessing** is a processing library that allows you to create, import, and export PDF documents from your code. You can use it in any web or desktop .NET application without relying on third-party software like Adobe Acrobat.|

In this article, we list the library's most popular features. If you want to learn how to use the library, head straight to the **[Getting Started with RadPdfProcessing]({%slug radpdfprocessing-getting-started%})** article.

>note If you still don't have **Telerik Document Processing installed**, check the **[First Steps]({%slug getting-started-first-steps%})** topic to learn how to obtain the packages through the different suites with Telerik controls.

The API of RadPdfProcessing contains two different editors,  [RadFixedDocumentEditor]({%slug radpdfprocessing-editing-radfixeddocumenteditor%}) and  [FixedContentEditor]({%slug radpdfprocessing-editing-fixedcontenteditor%}), enabling you to choose between editing in a **flow-like** manner or using the much more powerful and flexible **fixed** document structure that allows you to draw on the page.

## Key Features 
            
The document model of the library provides support for:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**Pages**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-radfixedpage%}) | Adding, modifying or removing of pages in a document. The properties enable you to change the size of the page, its rotation, and more. |
| **Automatic layout** | Although the PDF format is fixed, sometimes you will need to insert the content in a way that flows on the page. RadPdfProcessing enables to achieve this easily by using  [blocks]({%slug radpdfprocessing-editing-block%}), [tables]({%slug radpdfprocessing-editing-table%}) and [lists]({%slug radpdfprocessing-editing-list%}). |
| [**Images**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-image%}) | Decoded on demand to achieve better performance. The API enables you to obtain the encoded image data. You can also control the image quality when saving the document. |
| [**Geometries**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-concepts-geometry%}) | Enable you to describe the geometry of a 2D shape. |
| [**Form XObjects**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-form%}) | The Form XObjects enables you to describe composite objects (consisting of text, images, vector elements, etc.) within a PDF file and reuse this content among the document, for smaller document size and better rendering performance. |
| [**Interactive Forms**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-interactive-forms-overview%}) | Create and modify PDF files containing textboxes, buttons, list boxes, and other interactive controls making available for the PDF file user to interactively fill some data in the PDF document and/or digitally sign the filled document. You can flatten the fields as well. |
| [**Digital Signature**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-features-digital-signature%}) | The digital signature feature enables you to sign and validate PDF documents (limited supported in .NET Standard). |
|[**Embedded File Streams**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-embedded-file-streams-overview%})|The embed a file stream feature allows adding external files to the PDF document.|
| [**Clipping**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-concepts-clipping%}) | You can define the outline of other content elements like images and paths. |
| [**Bookmarks (Outlines)**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-features-bookmarks%}) | Add, remove or modify the bookmarks in a PDF document. |
| [**Annotations**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-annotations-overview%}) | Associate an object with a location on a page of the PDF document. |
| [**Destinations**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-annotations-links%}#destination) | Defines a particular view of a document.|
| [**Colors and Color Spaces**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-concepts-colors-and-color-spaces%}) | Support for different types of both. |
| [**Fonts**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-concepts-fonts%}) | Support for the standard PDF fonts, Type0, Type1, Type 3, CIDFontType2, TrueType and more. |
| [**Text and Graphic properties**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-editing-text-and-graphic-properties%}) | Provide options for changing the properties of the different elements in the document elements so you can achieve a unique look. |
| [**Password Protection**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-formats-and-conversion-pdf-settings%}#import-settings) | Support for documents encrypted with **Encryption Algorithm 4 (RC4/AES-128) and Encryption Algorithm 5 with AES 256** |
| [**Merge documents**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-radfixeddocument%}) and [**document pages**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-formats-and-conversion-pdf-pdfstreamwriter-pdfpagesource%}) | You can combine the pages from multiple documents into a single document. |
| [**PdfStreamWriter**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-formats-and-conversion-pdf-pdfstreamwriter-overview%})| The API exposes a functionality that provides an option for exporting PDF files with unmatched performance and minimized memory footprint. Extremely useful when you need to add some content to an existing document, merge or split documents. |
| [**Import of PDF and export to PDF or plain text**]({%slug radpdfprocessing-formats-and-conversion-pdf-pdfformatprovider%}) | You can import or export PDF files and convert PDF files to plain text. |
