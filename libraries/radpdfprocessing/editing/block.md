# Block



The __Block__ class is intended to arrange the elements added to it in a flow-like manner. It can be used for measuring, drawing, and splitting of __FixedContentElements__.
      

## Add and Modify Content

The most common usage of __Block__ is to draw flowing content. Similarly to [FixedContentEditor]({%slug radpdfprocessing-editing-fixedcontenteditor%}), a block can contain images, graphics or text. The same Block instance can only be drawn once.
        

### Inserting Text

Inserting [TextFragments]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-textfragment%}) is achieved with one of the overloads of the __Insert()__ method. __Example 1__ shows a simple insert by passing a string to the method.
            

#### __[C#] Example 1: Insert text__

{{region cs-radpdfprocessing-editing-block_0}}
	Block block = new Block();
	block.InsertText("Text");
{{endregion}}



__Example 2__ demonstrates how to insert text with a specific font family.
            

#### __[C#] Example 2: Insert text with Arial font family__

{{region cs-radpdfprocessing-editing-block_1}}
	block.InsertText(new FontFamily("Arial"), "Text");
{{endregion}}

There is an additional overload of the InsertText() method enabling you to specify the font family, font style and font weight for the text which you would like to insert.

#### __[C#] Example 3: Insert styled text__

{{region cs-radpdfprocessing-editing-block_2}}
	block.InsertText(new FontFamily("Arial"), FontStyles.Italic, FontWeights.Bold, "Text");
{{endregion}}

>The '\r' and '\n' characters don't have the usual meaning of "go to next line" when they are inserted into a PDF document and you cannot simply insert text containing these characters to produce multiline text. Instead, you should insert a line break.


### Inserting Line Break

Inserting a line break results in the next element starting on a new line. The action is achieved with the __InsertLineBreak()__ method as shown in __Example 4__.
            

#### __[C#] Example 4: Break the line__

{{region cs-radpdfprocessing-editing-block_3}}
	block.InsertLineBreak();
{{endregion}}



### Inserting Image

__Block__ provides the following methods for inserting images:
            

* block.InsertImage(imageSource);
* block.InsertImage(stream);
* block.InsertImage(imageSource, size);
* block.InsertImage(stream, size);
* block.InsertImage(imageSource, width, height);
* block.InsertImage(stream, width, height);
                

Information on images in the context of the library is available in the [ImageSource]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-imagesource%}) and [Image]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-image%}) articles.
            

### Inserting Geometries

[Geometries]({%slug radpdfprocessing-concepts-geometry%}) allow you to describe 2D shapes in a document. The following methods can be used to insert different geometries.
            

* block.**InsertCircle**(center, radius);
* block.**InsertEllipse**(center, radiusX, radiusY);
* block.**InsertLine**(point1, point2);
* block.**InsertPath**(geometry);
* block.**InsertRectangle**(rectangle);
                

### Inserting Form-XObject Elements

The Form (or also known as Form-XObject) is an object that can contain PDF content and can be sheared among the document. The Block class exposes the **InsertForm()** method that allows you insert a FormSource object in the document. 

#### __[C#] Example 5: Insert a form__

{{region cs-radpdfprocessing-editing-block_4}}
	block.InsertForm(simpleForm);
{{endregion}}

There are two more overloads of InsertForm() that enables you to pass the size that should be used for the form.


>For more information on how to create a form, check the [Form]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-form%}) and [FormSource]({%slug radpdfprocessing-model-formsource%}) articles.


### Changing Current Styles

The __Block__ class has some properties and methods that affect how it will be rendered:
            

* __SpacingBefore:__ Represent the spacing before.
                

* __SpacingAfter:__ Represents the spacing after.
                

* __LineSpacing:__ The spacing between the lines.


* __LineSpacingType:__ Specifies how to interpret the line spacing.
                

* __FirstLineIndent:__ The indent for the first line.
                

* __LeftIndent:__ The left indent.
                

* __RightIndent:__ The right indent.
                

* __BackgroundColor:__ The background color.
                

* __HorizontalAlignment:__ The horizontal alignment of the content.
                

* __VerticalAlignment:__ The vertical alignment of the content.


* __Bullet__: The element that should be rendered as __Block__’s list bullet.


* __IndentAfterBullet__: The indent size after the bullet element.


* __TextProperties__ and __GraphicProperties__: Responsible for text and graphic properties. For more information see the [Text and Graphic Properties]({%slug radpdfprocessing-editing-text-and-graphic-properties%}) article.
                

* __SaveTextProperties():__ Saves the TextProperties. It returns an IDisposable object which when disposed calls __RestoreTextProperties()__ and can be used in using statement.
                

* __RestoreTextProperties():__ Restores the TextProperties to their previous state.
                

* __SaveGraphicProperties():__ Saves the GraphicProperties. It returns an IDisposable object which when disposed calls __RestoreTextProperties()__ and can be used in using statement.
                

* __RestoreGraphicProperties():__ Restores the GrahpicPropertie to their previous state.
                

* __SaveProperties():__ Saves both text and graphic properties. It returns an IDisposable object which when disposed calls __RestoreTextProperties()__ and can be used in using statement.
                

* __RestoreProperties():__ Restores both text and graphic properties.

* __SetBullet(List list, int listLevel):__ This method helps you to easily set bullet related properties respecting the numbering and the formatting of some List class instance. More information about lists you may find in [this article](#{%slug radpdfprocessing-editing-list%}).
                

* __Clear():__ Clears all elements in the block.
                

#### __[C#] Example 6: Change Block properties__

{{region cs-radpdfprocessing-editing-block_5}}
	Block block = new Block();
	block.InsertText("block content");

	block.SpacingBefore = 10;
	block.SpacingAfter = 5;
	block.LineSpacingType = HeightType.Exact;
	block.LineSpacing = 15;
	block.FirstLineIndent = 12;
	block.LeftIndent = 0;
	block.RightIndent = 0;
	block.BackgroundColor = RgbColors.White;
	block.HorizontalAlignment = Telerik.Windows.Documents.Fixed.Model.Editing.Flow.HorizontalAlignment.Left;
	block.VerticalAlignment = Telerik.Windows.Documents.Fixed.Model.Editing.Flow.VerticalAlignment.Top;

	var textFragment = new TextFragment();
	textFragment.Text = "test bullet";
	block.Bullet = textFragment;
	block.IndentAfterBullet = 5;
{{endregion}}


## Drawing a Block

A Block can be drawn to the content using the __Draw()__ method. The method accepts as a parameter a __Rectangle__, specifying the desired size and position relatively to the editor of the element.
        
#### __[C#] Example 7: Draw block__

{{region cs-radpdfprocessing-editing-block_6}}
	Rect boundingRect = new Rect(new Point(0, 0), new Size(200, 300));
	block.Draw(fixedContentEditor, boundingRect);
{{endregion}}



>importantEvery block can be drawn only once. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.
          

## Measuring Block Size

Measuring a Block can be achieved with one of the overloads of the __Measure()__ method. Invoking the method without a parameter will return the desired size of the elements in the block and set the block's __DesiredSize__ property. The method is handy when you want to determine the size of the Block. When you want to wrap the text or you page has a limited space make sure to pass the available size to the method. 
        
Calling the overload accepting available size measures the block in that specific size. Additionally to setting the __DesiredSize__ property, it sets the __PendingElements__ property with a collection of the elements that could not fit in the available size.
        

__Example 8__ creates a Block with the text "Hello RadPdfProcessing!" and measures it.
        

#### __[C#] Example 8: Measure block__

{{region cs-radpdfprocessing-editing-block_7}}
	Block block = new Block();
	block.InsertText("Hello RadPdfProcessing!");
	Size size = block.Measure();
{{endregion}}



## Splitting a Block

The __Split()__ method of a Block returns a new Block with the same properties. The resulting block contains all pending elements that do not fit in the current block, based on the result of the last measure call.
        

The code in __Example 9__ splits a block in two. The first will contains text "Hello" and the second – "RadPdfProcessing!".
        
#### __[C#] Example 9: Split block__

{{region cs-radpdfprocessing-editing-block_8}}
	Block helloBlock = new Block();
	helloBlock.InsertText("Hello");
	Size helloSize = helloBlock.Measure();
	
	Block block = new Block();
	block.InsertText("Hello RadPdfProcessing!");
	Size size = block.Measure(helloSize);
	Block secondBlock = block.Split();
{{endregion}}
