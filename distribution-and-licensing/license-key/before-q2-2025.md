# Licensing before 2025

[Telerik Document Processing]({%slug introduction%}) used to come in separate **Trial** and **Developer** (or commercial) assets distribution until Q2 2025.

![License Mechanism](images/license-mechanism.png)    

>caution After launching the [new licensing mechanism](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/license-key-files-telerik-kendo-ui-products-2025-update), the activation is performed through a [license key]({%slug setting-up-license-key%}) (trial or commercial). Upgrading from a Trial to Developer (or commercial) version requires only updating the license key without the necessity of reinstalling the respective Telerik product.

## Trial Licenses

Telerik Document Processing is available under a 30-day trial license with a full-featured version of the tool—no restrictions! What’s more, you are eligible for complete technical support during your trial period in case you have any questions. 

The free trial licenses of all Telerik products are fully functional and will work for an unlimited time, but will randomly display a copyright message. These builds have the `Trial` abbreviation in their file names. To use the trial version of Telerik Document Processing, you need to agree to the [End User License Agreement (EULA)]({%slug license-agreement%}).

* To sign up for a free 30-day trial, [Log in to your Telerik account or create one](https://www.telerik.com/account).
* To download the trial version, refer to the [Telerik Document Processing's Product page](https://www.telerik.com/document-processing-libraries).
* To download a developer build with a trial license, log into your [Telerik account](https://www.telerik.com/account/).

## Developer Licenses

Telerik Document Processing also offers a developer license. To use Telerik Document Processing commercially, you need to purchase a license and to agree to the terms of use, which are fully described in the [End User License Agreement (EULA)]({%slug license-agreement%}).

Developer licenses come with modified DLLs, which work without displaying copyright messages. If you have a Developer license for one or more Telerik components, you need to ensure that you are using the developer build when downloading the libraries. These builds have the `Dev` abbreviation in their file names.

If your application is displaying a copyright message intermittently, this means that you are using a trial version of the product. Log in to your [Telerik account and download](https://www.telerik.com/account/downloads) the developer build by choosing the product from the available Licenses.

For more information on the commercial terms, refer to the pricing list of the [available developer licenses which include Telerik Document Processing](https://www.telerik.com/purchase.aspx) 

## Upgrading from Trial to Developer

To upgrade the trial version of your license to a developer license:

1. Back up your Telerik Document Processing files and folders especially if your project uses the settings that are included in them.
1. Uninstall the __Trial__ version of the Telerik product with which you have obtained the Document Processing libraries either by using the __Start Menu__ shortcut or the __Add/Remove Programs__ dialog.
1. Obtain the new __Dev__ installer and [install Telerik Document Processing]({%slug installation-installing-on-your-computer%}).
