# Trial License Limitations

The free trial license of Telerik Document Processing is fully functional and will work for an unlimited time.

The only difference between the developer and trial versions of the assemblies is that trial assemblies add a copyright message to the produced documents.

In PDF and flow formats, this is a message at the top of the document, whereas for XLSX documents the message is added to a separate sheet.
