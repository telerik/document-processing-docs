# Installing on Your Computer

>important Please install **&lt;PackageReference Include="Telerik.Licensing" Version="1.*" /&gt;**.

Telerik Document Processing is part of several Telerik bundles and is installed following the steps for installing the suite with which you've obtained the product.

>Starting from Q1 2016, the Document Processing assemblies have an assembly version which may differ from the assembly version of the other assemblies in the particular suite. 
>
>Starting from R3 2016, only assemblies with a version number ending with .40 suffix are distributed. The libraries don't contain code specific for .NET Framework 4.5, thus an additional version is not needed.
>
>The changes are synced between the controls that have a dependency on Telerik Document Processing and while the referenced files are from the same release, they should work as expected regardless of the version distinction.
