# Welcome to Telerik Document Processing Libraries

Telerik Document Processing is a bundle of UI-independent cross-platform libraries that enable you to process the most commonly used text, PDF, and spreadsheet file formats. The Document Processing library allows you to create, import, modify and export documents without relying on external dependencies like Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Office.

For more details about the benefits of using Telerik Document Processing, see the [Telerik Document Processing product overview page](https://www.telerik.com/document-processing-libraries).
